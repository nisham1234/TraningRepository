Actor Parvathy Thiruvothu said, “The loss is impossible to express in words. We start celebrating legends once they leave us. But we celebrate Sreeni sir every day. He was celebrated not just for his contributions and his cinema, but for the person that he is. I hope he rests in peace.”

Director Sathyan Anthikad, a contemporary of Sreenivasan, stood alongside the family, consoling them and assisting with the final rites. Sreenivasan had been ailing for the past several years.
